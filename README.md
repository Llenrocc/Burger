# Burger

BURGER is an application that allows the user to create burgers, and then devour them!

## Usage

- Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names and toppings of burgers that they would like to eat. 
- Once a user submits a burgers name, the app will display that burger, and wait for you to devour it. 
- Each burger that is listed has a Devour button beside it. 
- Once Devour it has been clicked, the burger will move the other side of the page signifying that is has been eaten. 
- The application will store every burger in the databse, whether or not it has been devoured. 

## Usage

- In the text area, type in the name of the burger that you would like to eat.
- Burgers that you have created will appear in a waiting area.
- Each burger in the waiting area will have a Devour It button beside it
- Once you have clicked "Devour It", the burger will then move to the Eaten column. 

## Issues

This is the error message I get when I try to connect MySql database to VS code. I have gone through troubleshooting and am just not sure anymore why I cannot connect. 

``` mssql: Error: Unable to connect using the connection information provided. Retry profile creation? ```
